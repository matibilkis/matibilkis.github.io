# START HERE (5–10 min)

Goal: ship a clean, on-brand website on GitHub Pages today.

## What to do (in order)
1. Read `docs/BRAND_PALETTE_GUIDE.md` (first section only).
2. Open `docs/CURSOR_PROMPTS.md` and copy PROMPT 1 into Cursor Composer.
3. Extract old site content (copy text + links + key sections you want to keep).
4. Archive the old site in git (branch or folder).
5. Use Cursor with PROMPT 1 to rebuild the site.
6. Test locally in browser.
7. Deploy by pushing to GitHub (GitHub Pages).

## Repo conventions (suggested)
- Content pages live in `index.html` + `/assets/` (or Jekyll if you already use it).
- Brand rules live in `/docs/`.
- Old site archived in `/archive/` or `old_site/` (never deleted, just moved).

## Definition of done
- Site builds without errors.
- Homepage loads locally.
- Colors/typography follow the brand guide.
- Deployed site matches local build.
