Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of ongoing projects I am supervising, described via some questions :) If any of this resonates with you, don’t hesitate to reach out, I’m happy to talk!

QuantumAISounds!
In which ways do we do music with quantum devices? Can we formulate a different live-coding framework intrinsically running on a quantum sensing experiment? How can quantum theory help with musicians/artists inspiration, and how can this new musical frameworks help scientists to better understand quantum phenomena [use cases].
<hr>

Aesthetics & quantum AI
Can an artificial learning learning model capture the spirit behind an artwork? How can this be translated to a quantum-learning scheme? Are there any metaphors, analogies or morals that quantum theory can provide us to assess this complicated question?
<hr>

Reinforcement Learning & Quantum systems
Can an interacting RL agent be boosted by quantum phenomena happening in the lab? How can an RL agent be teached to control an experiment? Which are the limits when it comes to learning from experiments?
<hr>
Quantum Generative AI
Can classical shadows provide a way to generate new (classical) data? Can this generation be made more efficient? Which is the simplest generative model that yet provides meaningful output? Can this minimal generative model be boosted with quantum effects?
<hr>
Quantum Sketches
What can we learn from computer vision? Can we find better classical datasets to benchmark the power of NISQ devices? Can we draw inspiration from machine learning models to make nature draw?
<hr>
Quantum info and more
Which are the limits to learning dynamical equations of motion out of quantum data? Can we learn quantum master equations by a sensing apparatus?
What lessons can we learn from simulating quantum physics in classical computers? Are there any metrics to account for the error in our simulations, that are yet efficiently computable?
