    <h2>La belleza del error: la creatividad en la física, en la IA y en la música</h2>

    <i>How much do we assert by denying? Does beauty emerge from symmetry, or rather from the
    the lack of it? Where is the frontier between casuality and causality? What are the limits of
    our creation? What are the limits of our creativity? </i>
    This talk takes place between these questions and the lack of their answer. With the
    intention of making room for debate on what it means to do science and/or art, we will
    perform a little experiment where Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents interact with musicians
    in real-time. The agents will first learn the instructions given by the musician, and will
    subsequently collaborate with each other in order to create a musical piece. The question on
    how creation, beauty, mistakes and the lack of answers relate with each other will guide us
    along this journey.
