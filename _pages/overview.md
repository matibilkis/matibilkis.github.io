Hola! Thanks for your interest, and welcome to my personal website! In here you'll find some info about me, and some selected projects I want to share about my professional and also personal life. Hopefully some of these stuff resonates with you and your background, and don't hesitate to reach out to me!



I studied physics in La Plata, and moved to Barcelona back in 2018 to do a PhD in quantum information science and machine learning. Since 2025 I have settled back in Buenos Aires.

I have created and lead the Quantum Machine Learning Group, at the Computer Vision Center of Barcelona (QML-CVC).The QML-CVC is an interdisciplinary research group, working with physicists, computer scientists, artists, psychologists and more! We like to study different frameworks in quantum physics under which the quantum AI symbiosis takes place, with a strong focus on evaluating the social impact of quantum tech. Among many (IMO cool) projects, I am very enthusiastic in developing new narratives that help us elucidate interdisciplinary research directions, so as to unveiling its potential in citizen engagement for political causes. As part of this, I collaborate with Cátedra UAB-Cruilla (which is an institute studying the impact of AI in music & arts), I do random outreach activities and talks, and also been teaching "Social Innovation" subject in the AI degree at UAB.

If you are interested in joining my group, either as a student or a postdoc, feel free to directly email me → mbilkis{at}cvc.uab.cat
