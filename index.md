        People know me for being an expert in <strong>quantum tech & machine learning</strong>, both in the theory and the applied side, and both from an industry and academic perspective, with an add-on of having pretty good <em>soft skills</em>. If you don't know that topic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkHlyQxSkaU">check out my introductory talk</a>, and if you are curious about the industrial impact of quantum tech, also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELZt_7dH7Xw">this</a> seminar series.

        I did my <strong>PhD on quantum machine learning</strong> (physics, Autonomous University of Barcelona <a href="https://giq.uab.cat">@giq-uab</a>, supervised by Prof. John Calsamiglia, and during which I briefly worked at <a href="https://www.lanl.gov">@Los Alamos National Lab</a>, developing <a href="https://github.com/matibilkis/vans">Vans</a> - SoTA method by then-quantum neural net architecture search). More on my <a href="https://github.com/matibilkis">GitHub portfolio</a>, w/ <a href="{{ '/curriculums/resources/cvs/' | relative_url }}">academic CV</a> & <a href="{{ '/curriculums/resources/cvs/' | relative_url }}">technical CV</a>. As a postdoc, I co-founded and co-led the <a href="https://qml.cvc.uab.es"><strong>QML-CVC research group</strong></a> in the <a href="https://www.cvc.uab.es">Computer Vision Center of Barcelona</a>, w/ 10+ people and a lot of high-quality research fun(ds!), developing and <em>curating</em> an excellent international network (check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@qml-cvc">seminars</a>, <a href="/papers">papers</a>!). I am currently based in La Plata, Argentina.
