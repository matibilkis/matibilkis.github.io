<b>Quantum technologist:</b> I am an expert in <b> machine learning </b> and <b> quantum technologies </b>. I have then created the [Quantum Machine Learning research group](https://qml.cvc.uab.es/), in the [Comptuer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es/). My motivation is <i>discovering concrete applications of quantum machine learning technologies</i>.

<b>Researcher:</b> I hold a <b>PhD in physics</b>, and <b>group leader</b> of QML-CVC. My research is inter-disciplinary, and I spend a lot of efforts in ML and physics communities to work on QML.


<b>Scientific communicator and advisor:</b> During these years I gained a lot of experience in both communicating complex scientific results, and devising strategic actions for scientific and technology initiatives. I work with both public and private institutions to develop quantum tech agendas adapted to this rapidly-changing times.

<!-- Among many activities, I organize the QML-CVC seminar series. Additionally, I am an active member of RIPAISC net for quantum software engineering,  -->

<!-- The QML-CVC is an interdisciplinary research group, working with physicists, computer scientists, artists, psychologists and more! We like to study different frameworks in quantum physics under which the quantum AI symbiosis takes place, with a strong focus on evaluating the social impact of quantum tech.
I am very enthusiastic in developing new narratives that help us elucidate interdisciplinary research directions, so as to unveiling its potential in citizen engagement for political causes. As part of this, I collaborate with Cátedra UAB-Cruilla, I strongly participate in outreach activities & talks, and also been teaching "Social Innovation" subject in the AI degree at UAB. -->
