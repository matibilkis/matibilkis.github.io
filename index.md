        People know me for being an expert in <strong>quantum tech & machine learning</strong>, both in the theory and the applied side, and both from an industry and academic perspective, with an add-on of having pretty good <em>soft skills</em>. If you don't know that topic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkHlyQxSkaU">check out my introductory talk</a>, and if you are curious about the industrial impact of quantum tech, also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELZt_7dH7Xw">this</a> seminar series.

        I did my <strong>PhD on quantum machine learning</strong> (physics, Autonomous University of Barcelona <a href="https://giq.uab.cat">@giq-uab</a>, supervised by Prof. John Calsamiglia, and during which I briefly worked at <a href="https://www.lanl.gov">@Los Alamos National Lab</a>, developing <a href="https://github.com/matibilkis/vans">Vans</a> - SoTA method by then-quantum neural net architecture search). More on my <a href="https://github.com/matibilkis">GitHub portfolio</a>, w/ <a href="{{ '/curriculums/resources/cvs/' | relative_url }}">academic CV</a> & <a href="{{ '/curriculums/resources/cvs/' | relative_url }}">technical CV</a>. As a postdoc, I co-founded and co-led the <a href="https://qml.cvc.uab.es"><strong>QML-CVC research group</strong></a> in the <a href="https://www.cvc.uab.es">Computer Vision Center of Barcelona</a>, w/ 10+ people and a lot of high-quality research fun(ds!), developing and <em>curating</em> an excellent international network (check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@qml-cvc">seminars</a>, <a href="/papers">papers</a>!).

        During the last year, I decided to settle back in La Plata, my hometown (where <a href="http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/67996">I studied physics</a> in the first place, at <a href="https://unlp.edu.ar">UNLP</a>). There's a super hard tradeoff here: while close to family and the dear ones, getting back in these times almost looks like <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bFFWTIEAAAAJ&hl=en">scientific / professional suicide</a>. Because of this, <strong>I've been pushing for many projects in the quantum-tech ecosystem building umbrella</strong> (check full list <a href="https://github.com/matibilkis">here</a>), trying to bring society (and not only business/companies) closer to emergent [quantum/AI] tech. Among those efforts, I am designing <strong>a quantum social incubator</strong> in the Bay Area w/ <a href="https://www.edgecity.live">Edge City</a>, <strong>working to expand Argentina HPC</strong> with <a href="https://www.fundacionsadosky.org.ar">FS</a> & <a href="https://www.nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a> (setting up a quantum-simulation dedicated GPUs node running <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-q">cuda-q</a>), and starting & directing the first <strong>applied quantum software engineering master program</strong> in South America at <a href="https://www.uai.edu.ar">@UAI</a>, where I am a <strong>staff professor</strong> (this is a part-time job, super nice but not enough to pay my bills). On the business side, I am initiating <a href="https://qutsur.com"><strong>QutSur LLC</strong></a>, serving as an emergent-tech monitor & high-ROI incubator node, that steers scientific, engineering and technical talent to focus on massive AI-tech adoption (targeting, in particular, Argentinian SMEs) with a quantum-adoption horizon.
