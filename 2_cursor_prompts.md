# Cursor Prompts

## PROMPT 1 — Website rebuild (copy into Cursor Composer)

You are upgrading my personal website to be clean, fast, and on-brand.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not add new pages unless asked.
- Preserve existing content meaning (do not invent).
- Prioritize readability, clear navigation, and fast load.
- Apply the palette rules from `docs/BRAND_PALETTE_GUIDE.md` (first section).
- Keep code minimal and maintainable.
- Output must be deployable on GitHub Pages.

TASK:
1) Inspect the current repo structure and identify how the site is built (plain HTML vs Jekyll).
2) Propose a minimal plan (max 6 bullets).
3) Implement changes:
   - Update layout/typography/colors to match the brand guide.
   - Improve homepage hierarchy: hero (name + 1-liner), key links, selected work, contact.
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness.
4) Tell me exactly how to run locally and how to deploy.

When unsure, ask one clarifying question before making large structural changes.
